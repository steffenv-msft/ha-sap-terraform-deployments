## SAP HANA and HA cluster
Depending on the provider used to deploy SAP HANA and the HA cluster,
the required parameters are slightly different, even though most of them
match.

For user wants to deploy DRBD(NFS) cluster with HANA,
[DRBD cluster](#drbd-cluster-for-nfs) is also necessary to configure.

Two possibilities here:

  - For a preconfigured environment, you can use pillar files which are in [HANA automatic directory](./automatic/hana).

      **Could be used for testing purpose and not for production as they have default settings.**

      From git top-level folder, copy files:

      `cp pillar_examples/automatic/hana/*.sls salt/hana_node/files/pillar/`

  - For a customize and production environment, you must use pillar files which are in your choosen [provider directory](../pillar_examples) (AWS, Azure, GCP, Libvirt).

      From git top-level folder, copy files:

      `cp pillar_examples/$PROVIDER/*.sls salt/hana_node/files/pillar`

      Please, **pay attention:** different from the previous case (preconfigured environment or automatic), the pillars must be customized, otherwise deployment will fail.

All the information about how to tune the deployment is available in:
- https://github.com/SUSE/saphanabootstrap-formula (to manipulate the hana.sls file)
- https://github.com/SUSE/habootstrap-formula (to manipulate the cluster.sls file)

### Libvirt specifics

One thing is different with Libvirt provider, in pillar's directory, you will find two directories about HANA profiles (cost_optimized and performance_optimized).
Choose one according to your needs.

Finally, if instead of deploying SAP HANA and the cluster together, to only
deploy one of them update the salt/hana_node/files/salt/top.sls file only using
the desired component and removing/commenting the other.

# Pillar encryption

Pillars are expected to contain private data such as user passwords required for the automated installation or other operations. Therefore, such pillar data need to be stored in an encrypted state, which can be decrypted during pillar compilation.

SaltStack GPG renderer provides a secure encryption/decryption of pillar data. The configuration of GPG keys and procedure for pillar encryption are desribed in the Saltstack documentation guide:

- [SaltStack pillar encryption](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/pillar/#pillar-encryption)

- [SALT GPG RENDERERS](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/renderers/all/salt.renderers.gpg.html)

**Note:**
- Only passwordless gpg keys are supported, and the already existing keys cannot be used.

- If a masterless approach is used (as in the current automated deployment) the gpg private key must be imported in all the nodes. This might require the copy/paste of the keys.

## DRBD cluster (for NFS)
Depending on the provider used to deploy DRBD cluster for NFS,
the required parameters are slightly different, even though most
of them match.

  - For a preconfigured environment, you can use pillar files which are in [DRBD automatic directory](./automatic/drbd)

      **Could be used for testing purpose and not for production as they have default settings.**

      From git top-level folder, copy files:

      `cp pillar_examples/automatic/drbd/*.sls salt/drbd_node/files/pillar/`

- https://github.com/SUSE/habootstrap-formula (to manipulate the cluster.sls file)
